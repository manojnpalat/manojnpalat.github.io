## Project.1 -  NITCONF
Objective: Understand how to evolve the requirements, design, coding, and testing and running through some of the major software engineering principles hands-on.

### Requirement:

NITCONF is a conference which we want to have. This requires a website which will help people submit papers for evaluation. A team of reviewers will review these papers. A Program Committee will then decide and then will send notification to the speakers.

More Details - your project can have more:
 - Let there be just a button where there is a CFP - Call for papers. A click on this will take the speaker to a login site, and he/she can submit abstracts. Anyone can be a speaker.
 - Let there be another link where a designated reviewer can login and give comments on the paper. There should be a button which should say what the ranking of the paper is on a scale.
 - Let there be a third link where a member of a program committee can login and see the review comments of all the papers and a facility to take decision to accept or reject the paper.

### Examples

Examples  of a conference sites could be:

 - [ EclipseCon 2023 ](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2023)
 - Pick any conference site where the CFP (Call For Papers) is open to get an idea.

### First Task
Come up with requirement specifications in md format- - please add diagrams as required - This should be added in github so that review comment can be given.
