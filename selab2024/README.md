Details about the SELab2024.1 activities captured in this page. Please watch the videos also associated with this lab - [ The Entire Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOPzKCvRVTeXjksSzuzxXl0ZOIHzTLIRU&feature=shared)

## Discussions
[SE Discussions](https://github.com/manojnpalat/manojnpalat.github.io/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aselab2024) - If you have any queries/general discussions on the SE lectures or the lab, please ask here - please put the label selab2024 and/or se2024 as appropriate

## First Setup
Objective: Gets hands-on with basic software engineering setup

- get a [ github account](https://github.com/)
- download [Spring Tools for Eclipse](https://spring.io/tools)
- Fork from [SELab site](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics) based on [Spring guides rest](https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-rest)
- Use [SSH Connections](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- Use git repository view of STS and clone from your forked repository

## Project.1 -  NITCONF
Objective: Understand how to evolve the requirements, design, coding, and testing and running through some of the major software engineering principles hands-on.


### Requirement:

[NITCONF](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/22) is a conference Website. This would contain atleast the following components.

 - [ Main Page ](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/26)
 - [ Speaker Profile ](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/27)
 - [ CFP Page ](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/23)
 - [ Reviewer Page ](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/24)
 - [ Program Committee Page ](https://github.com/manojnpalat/selab23_basics/issues/25)

Follow the links under each heading. Each of them is an issue which may contain further (sub) issues. Finer details are captured under relevant issues.

### Examples

Examples  of a conference sites could be:

 - [ EclipseCon 2023 ](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2023)
 - Pick any conference site where the CFP (Call For Papers) is open to get an idea.

### Following the SE Principles
See the following videos:
- [ SE in practice ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vg3wVg-DNk&list=PLOPzKCvRVTeXjksSzuzxXl0ZOIHzTLIRU&index=2)
- [ Project Concepts Hands-On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRagc3lTOZg&list=PLOPzKCvRVTeXjksSzuzxXl0ZOIHzTLIRU&index=3)
- [ Issue Lifecycle Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8cCwkB1GM&list=PLOPzKCvRVTeXjksSzuzxXl0ZOIHzTLIRU&index=4)

### Evaluation

Evaluation of the lab will have multiple factors:
- Quality of the deliverable
- Software Engineering Practices Followed


Quality will be evaluated based on: 
 - Requirement Specification
 - Design Documents
 - Code - Implementation
 - Code - Tests

SE Practices will be evaluated based on: 
- Issues
- Branches
- Reviews
- Process


### First Task
Come up with requirement specifications in md format- - please add diagrams as required - This should be added in github so that review comment can be given.
